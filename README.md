# GCP-Training

End-to-End Machine Learning with TensorFlow on GCP

The purpose of this repository is to learn how to do machine learning at scale and how to build specialized machine-learning models for images, sequences, and recommendations.
It involves building an end-to-end model from data exploration all the way to deploying an ML model and getting predictions from it
